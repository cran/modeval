Description: Designed to assist novice to intermediate analysts in choosing
    an optimal classification model, particularly for working with relatively
    small data sets. It provides cross-validated results comparing several 
    different models at once using a consistent set of performance metrics,
    so users can hone in on the most promising approach rather than attempting
    single model fittings at a time. The package predefined 12 most common 
    classification models, although users are free to select from the 200+ 
    other options available in caret package.
